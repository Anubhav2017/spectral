This is the arpack++/examples/band/complex directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use
   ARPACK++ to solve complex band eigenvalue problems in various
   computational modes.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   bcompreg.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   bcompshf.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   bcompgre.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   bcompgsh.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the real shift and invert mode.


2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make bcompgsh".

3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (bcompgsh, for
   example).
