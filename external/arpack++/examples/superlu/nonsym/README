This is the arpack++/examples/superlu/nonsym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use
   ARPACK++ to solve real nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems in various
   computational modes in conjunction with the SuperLU package.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   lnsymreg.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   lnsymshf.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   lnsymgre.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   lnsymgsh.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the real shift and invert mode.

   lnsymgsc.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the complex shift and invert mode.

   lsvd.cc           In this example ARPACK++ is used to obtain a few
                     singular values of a real nonsymmetric matrix.

2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make lnsymgsh".

   Because the examples that use invert modes require the solution of
   some linear systems, the SuperLU library must be installed prior to
   compiling lnsymshf, lnsymgre, lnsymgsh and lnsymgsc.


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (lnsymgsh, for
   example).
