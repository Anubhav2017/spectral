/*
   ARPACK++ v1.0 8/1/1997
   c++ interface to ARPACK code.

   MODULE RNSymGSh.cc.
   Example program that illustrates how to solve a real
   nonsymmetric generalized eigenvalue problem in real shift
   and invert mode using the ARrcNonSymGenEig class.

   1) Problem description:

      In this example we try to solve A*x = B*x*lambda in shift and
      invert mode, where A and B are derived from the finite element
      discretization of the 1-dimensional convection-diffusion operator
                         (d^2u / dx^2) + rho*(du/dx)
      on the interval [0,1] with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions
      using linear elements.
      The shift sigma is a real number.

   2) Data structure used to represent matrix A:

      ARrcNonSymGenEig is a class that requires the user to provide a
      way to perform the matrix-vector products w = OP*Bv =
      inv(A-sigma*B)*B*v and w = B*v, where sigma is the adopted shift.
      In this example a class called NonSymGenProblemB was created with
      this purpose. NonSymGenProblemB contains a member function,
      MultOPv(v,w), that takes a vector v and returns the product OPv
      in w. It also contains an object, B, that stores matrix B data.
      The product Bv is performed by MultMv, a member function of B.

   3) The reverse communication interface:

      This example uses the reverse communication interface, which
      means that the desired eigenvalues cannot be obtained directly
      from an ARPACK++ class.
      Here, the overall process of finding eigenvalues by using the
      Arnoldi method is splitted into two parts. In the first, a
      sequence of calls to a function called TakeStep is combined
      with matrix-vector products in order to find an Arnoldi basis.
      In the second part, an ARPACK++ function like FindEigenvectors
      (or EigenValVectors) is used to extract eigenvalues and
      eigenvectors.
