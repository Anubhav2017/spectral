/*
   ARPACK++ v1.0 8/1/1997
   c++ interface to ARPACK code.

   MODULE RSVD.cc.
   Example program that illustrates how to use ARPACK++ 
   to compute the singular value decomposition of a real
   nonsymmetric matrix using the ARrcNonSymStdEig class.

   1) Problem description:

      In this example we try to solve (A'*A)*x = x*lambda in 
      regular mode (where A is a m by n real matrix) in order
      to find a few of the largest singular values of A and 
      the corresponding right singular vectors. 
      In this example, m is greater than n. To find the SVD
      of a matrix with m < n, the user must change the roles
      of A and A' in the above equation.

   2) Data structure used to represent matrix A:

      ARrcNonSymStdEig is a class that requires the user to provide
      a way to perform the matrix-vector product w = (A'*A)v. In this
      example a class called NonSymMatrixA was created with this 
      purpose. NonSymMatrixA contains a member function, MultOPv(v,w), 
      that takes a vector v and returns the product (A'*A)*v in w.

   3) The reverse communication interface:

      This example uses the reverse communication interface, which
      means that the desired eigenvalues cannot be obtained directly
      from an ARPACK++ class.
      Here, the overall process of finding eigenvalues by using the
      Arnoldi method is splitted into two parts. In the first, a
      sequence of calls to a function called TakeStep is combined
      with matrix-vector products in order to find an Arnoldi basis.
      In the second part, an ARPACK++ function like FindEigenvectors
      (or EigenValVectors) is used to extract eigenvalues and
      eigenvectors.
