This is the arpack++/examples/reverse/nonsym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use
   ARPACK++ to solve real nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems in various
   computational modes using the reverse communication interface.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   rnsymreg.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   rnsymshf.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   rnsymgre.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   rnsymgsh.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the real shift and invert mode.

   rnsymgsc.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the complex shift and invert mode
                     (considering only the real part of inv(A-sigmaB)).

   rsvd.cc           In this example ARPACK++ is used to obtain a few
                     singular values of a real nonsymmetric matrix.


2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make rnsymgsh".


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (rnsymgsh, for
   example).
