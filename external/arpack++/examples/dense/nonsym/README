This is the arpack++/examples/dense/nonsym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use
   ARPACK++ to solve real nonsymmetric dense eigenvalue problems 
   in various computational modes.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   dnsymreg.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   dnsymshf.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   dnsymgre.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   dnsymgsh.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the real shift and invert mode.

   dnsymgsc.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the complex shift and invert mode.


2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make dnsymgsh".


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (dnsymgsh, for
   example).
