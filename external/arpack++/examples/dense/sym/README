This is the arpack++/examples/dense/sym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use
   ARPACK++ to solve real symmetric dense eigenvalue problems in
   various computational modes.

   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   dsymreg.cc        In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   dsymshft.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   dsymgreg.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   dsymgshf.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   dsymgbkl.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the buckling mode.

   dsymgcay.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the Cayley mode.


2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make dsymgshf".


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (dsymgshf, for
   example).
