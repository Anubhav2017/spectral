This is the arpack++/examples/product/nonsym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use 
   ARPACK++ to solve real nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems in various
   computational modes when the user is able to supply some classes that
   contain all required matrix-vector products as member functions.

   nsymreg.cc        In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   nsymshf.cc        In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   nsymgreg.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   nsymgshf.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the real shift and invert mode.

   nsymgscr.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the complex shift and invert mode
                     (considering only the real part of inv(A-sigmaB)).

   nsymgsci.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the complex shift and invert mode
                     (considering only the imaginary part of
                     inv(A-sigmaB)).

   svd.cc            In this example ARPACK++ is used to obtain a few
                     singular values of a real nonsymmetric matrix.

2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make nsymgshf".


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (nsymgshf, for
   example).
