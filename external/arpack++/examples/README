This is the ARPACK++ examples directory.
The examples included here are intended to illustrate how
to use arpack++ to solve different eigenvalue problems
taking advantage of various features included in the
software.

Subdirectories:

   a) areig:

   This directory contains examples that use the AREig function.
   AREig is a MATLAB-style function intended to be the easiest
   way of solving eigenvalue problems.
   Because some of these examples contain spectral transformations
   that require the solution of linear systems, the SuperLU library
   must be installed prior to compiling the programs contained in
   this directory.
   Since the CC compiler does not allow function templates to have
   default parameters, none of the examples of the areig directory
   can be compiled with CC.

   b) superlu:

   This directory contains examples that show how to solve
   eigenvalue problems when matrices are supplied in CSC format.
   The SuperLU package is called by some examples to solve the
   linear systems that appear when a spectral transformation
   is used.

   c) umfpack:

   This directory contains the same examples of the superlu
   directory. However, UMFPACK is used to solve the linear
   systems, instead of SuperLU.

   d) product:

   This directory contains examples that show how to use ARPACK++
   to solve eigenvalue problems if user-defined matrix-vector
   product functions are available.

   e) reverse:

   This directory contains examples that illustrate how to use the
   reverse communication interface. In these examples, eigenvalue
   problems are declared using a set of ARPACK++ classes that does
   not store any information on how to perform the matrix-vector
   products required by the Arnoldi process, so all products must
   be performed directly by the user.

   f) band:

   This directory contains examples that illustrate how to solve
   band eigenvalue problems using ARPACK++. 

   g) dense:

   This directory contains examples that illustrate how to solve
   dense eigenvalue problems.

   h) harwell:

   This directory contains examples that illustrate how to solve
   eigenvalue problems when matrices are stored in harwell-boeing
   files.

   i) matrices:

   This directory contains the definition of all matrices used by
   the examples of the areig, band, superlu and umfpack directories.

   j) matprod:

   This directory contains the definition of all matrix classes
   used by the examples of the product and reverse directories.
