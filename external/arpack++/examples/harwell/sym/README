This is the arpack++/examples/harwell/sym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to use
   ARPACK++ to solve real symmetric eigenvalue problems stored in
   Harwell-Boeing files.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   hsymstd.cc        In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode or the shift and
                     invert mode.

   hsymgen.cc        In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved in regular, shift and invert, buckling
                     or Cayley mode.

2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make hsymgen".

   Because the examples that use invert modes require the solution of
   some linear systems, the SuperLU library must be installed prior to
   compiling both programs.


3) Running the examples:

   A brief explanation on how to correctly run a program is given by
   just typing its name ("hsymgen", for example).
