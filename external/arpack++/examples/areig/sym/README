This is the arpack++/examples/areig/sym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to solve
   real symmetric eigenvalue problems  in  various  computational
   modes using the AREig function in conjunction with the SuperLU
   package.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   asymreg.cc        In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   asymshft.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   asymgreg.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   asymgshf.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   asymgbkl.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the buckling mode.

   asymgcay.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the Cayley mode.


2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make asymgshf".

   Because the examples that use invert modes require the solution of
   some linear systems, the SuperLU library must be installed prior to
   compiling asymshf, asymgreg, asymgshf, asymgbkl and asymgcay.


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (asymgshf, for
   example).
