This is the arpack++/examples/areig/nonsym directory.

1) Examples included in this directory:

   This directory contains examples intended to show how to solve 
   real nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems in various computational 
   modes using the AREig function in conjunction with the SuperLU 
   package.

   file              Description
   -----------       --------------------------------------------------

   ansymreg.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   ansymshf.cc       In this example a standard eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the shift and invert mode.

   ansymgre.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the regular mode.

   ansymgsh.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the real shift and invert mode.

   ansymgsc.cc       In this example a generalized eigenvalue problem
                     is solved using the complex shift and invert mode.


2) Compiling the examples:

   To compile and link all the above mentioned programs you just have
   to type "make all". Each example can also be compiled separately by
   using a specific command, such as "make ansymgsh".

   Because the examples that use invert modes require the solution of
   some linear systems, the SuperLU library must be installed prior to
   compiling ansymshf, ansymgre, ansymgsh and ansymgsc.


3) Running the examples:

   A program is executed by just typing its name (ansymgsh, for
   example).
