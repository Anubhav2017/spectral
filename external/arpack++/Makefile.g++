# Defining ARPACK, LAPACK, UMFPACK, SUPERLU, BLAS and FORTRAN libraries.
# See the arpack++ manual or the README file for directions on how to 
# obtain arpack, umfpack and SuperLU packages. 
# UMFPACK_LIB and SUPERLU_LIB must be declared only if umfpack and superlu 
# are going to be used. BLAS and LAPACK fortran routines are distributed 
# along with arpack fortran code, but the user should verify if optimized 
# versions of these libraries are available before installing arpack. 
# The fortran libraries described below are those required to link
# fortran and c++ code together in a Sun SparcStation. Other libraries
# should be defined if the user intends to compile arpack++ on another
# environment.
