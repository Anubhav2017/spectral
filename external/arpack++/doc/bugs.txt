Known bugs:

1) The CC compiler has only a double precision complex class, so
   the examples that use single precision complex data will not
   work properly when compiled with CC.

2) Because function templates that contain default parameters are
   not allowed by the CC compiler, the examples under the areig 
   directory will not compile with CC.
